## Safe Area Context

https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/safe-area-context/
https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/safe-areas/

- Creating a safe area ensures your app screen's content is positioned correctly. This means it
  doesn't get overlapped by notches, status bars, home indicators, and other interface elements that
  are part of the device's physical hardware or are controlled by the operating system.
- `react-native-safe-area-context` provides a flexible API for accessing device safe area inset
  information. This allows you to position your content appropriately around notches, status bars,
  home indicators, and other such device and operating system interface elements.
- It also provides a `SafeAreaView` to render content within the safe area boundaries of a device.
- It's generally recommended to include `StatusBar` within `SafeAreaView` that is nested within a
  `SafeAreaProvider`.

## React Native StatusBar

https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar

- Component to control the app's status bar.
- E.g. `currentHeight` returns the height of the status bar (only in Android; returns `null` in
  iOS).
